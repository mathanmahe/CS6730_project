GENIE:=>GIRLS: Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa There's no question this Ali's alluring That physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak at the knee Everything about the man just plain impresses Well, get on out in that square He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder Adjust your veil and prepare He's about to pull my heart asunder To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali! And I absolutely love the way he dresses!
