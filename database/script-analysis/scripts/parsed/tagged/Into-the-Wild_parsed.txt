D: Tuesday, April 28th 1992
N: WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in North America. This is BIG Alaska. A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck. We can just make out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.
C: DRIVER
D: Hey!
N: The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK, stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of the truck.
C: DRIVER
D: Come here.
E: CONT'D
N: BACKPACK walks back to the truck. As he approaches the driver's door, we CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto the DRIVER.
C: DRIVER
D: You left your watch, your comb, your change...
E: CONT'D referring to items we see sitting on dashboard
N: We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:
C: BACKPACK
D: Keep it.
C: DRIVER
D: I don't want your money. And I already have a watch.
C: BACKPACK
D: If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it away. I don't want to know what time it is, what day it is, or where I am.
E: MORE
C: BACKPACK
D: I don't want to see anybody. None of that matters.
E: CONT'D
N: The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls out an old pair of rubber work boots.
C: DRIVER
D: Take em.
E: handing him the boots
N: There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the boots.
C: DRIVER
D: If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me.
E: CONT'D
N: We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the driver.
C: BACKPACK
D: Hey, do me a favor, will ya? Take a picture of me.
N: Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing.
T: CUT TO:
N: CU: driver CLICK. He snaps the shot. Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER. Driver hands him the camera.
C: DRIVER
D: You gonna be alright?
C: BACKPACK
D: I'll be better than that.
E: I'll be who I am.
N: As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the comb, and the watch on the dash. Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE

N: BACK TO: ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT: We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the Backpacker has exited the frame. The truck takes a BEAT, turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the direction from which it came. As the truck exits frame, we -

N: DAY
C: SUPER:
D: May 1990
N: The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students. Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn. INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace. One by one the names of graduates announced. Their bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to the podium to accept their diplomas. INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head. Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck. They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in sight. INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO CAMERA, the water streaming down his face. From the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris' absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap and gown. Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound, frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine "That's our Chris." And just as quickly as Chris has been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform steps.
T: TIME CUT:
N: SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a frame of blue sky. We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the sky to focus on his parents. (HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie delight upon the caps.) An outer glee in sharp contrast to voice over:
C: CHRIS
D: I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges, I see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone arch, the red tiles glinting like bent plates of blood behind his head, I see my mother with a few light books at her hip standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its sword-tips black in the May air, they are about to graduate, they are about to get married, they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are innocent, they would never hurt anybody. I want to go up to them and say Stop, don't do it--she's the wrong woman, he's the wrong man, you are going to do things you cannot imagine you would ever do, you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of, you are going to want to die. I want to go up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty blank face turning to me,
E: V.O. MORE
C: CHRIS
D: her pitiful beautiful untouched body, his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, his pitiful beautiful untouched body, but I don't do it. I want to live. I take them up like the male and female paper dolls and bang them together at the hips like chips of flint as if to strike sparks from them, I say...

N: Walt looks out the window and sees Chris drive up in his old yellow Datsun with Carine in the passenger seat beside him, and pulls up to the space beside the Cadillac.
S: INT. DATSUN
N: Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the LAST LINE OF THE POEM...

D: My grades are gonna be good enough, I think, to get into Harvard Law.
C: WALT
D: That's a big deal. What do you have left in your college fund?
C: CHRIS
D: It's an inheritance, dad. I've only been spending it as a college fund...Exactly twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars and sixty-eight cents.
C: BILLIE
D: That's very specific.
C: CHRIS
D: I had to go to the bank this morning.
C: WALT
D: Well, we'll certainly contribute the balance for Harvard.
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah. I've got to figure out what I'm going to do. I got a lot of things to pack and organize here first.
C: BILLIE
D: I'm so glad you're getting out of that place you're living. It was so much nicer when you lived on campus.
C: WALT
D: You'll come to Annandale before you disappear on us, won't you?

D: Sure, I will.

D: A new car? Why the hell would I want a new car? The Datsun runs great.
E: appalled MORE
C: CHRIS
D: Do you think I want some fancy boat? Or are you worried about what the neighbors might think?
E: CONT'D Mocking the Cadillac
C: BILLIE
D: We weren't going to get you a Cadillac, Chris. Just a nice new car that's safe to drive. You don't know when that thing's just going to suddenly blow up.
C: CHRIS
D: Blow up? Blow up?! Are you guys crazy? It's a great car. I don't need a new car. I don't want a new car. I don't want anything. Thing, thing, thing.

S: INT. OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE, SECOND-FLOOR, ATLANTA -
N: DAY OVER Chris' shoulder, he frisbees his graduation cap from the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on the street. As they wave goodbye, Carine catches the cap from the backseat window. And with a parting smile to her brother, she poses with it on her own head. Chris smiles and waves goodbye. As the Cadillac drifts away, his smile disappears into something other than sadness.
T: TIME CUT:
S: INT. OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT
N: In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly." We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor - Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak. Beside them, a camper's backpack. Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight. The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston) envelope. He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each, he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one. Finally coming to his social security card, he holds it to the candles flame. As the flame burns bright we -

S: EXT. ATLANTA HIGHWAY - SUNRISE'
N: MUSIC (Gordon Peterson's BIG HARD SUN or as radio source Tom Petty's FREE FALLING) rises and PRESENTATION TITLES OVER: A 1982 DATSUN B210 emerges from the rising sun as the car heads west out of Atlanta. (HIGHWAY 20 TO 78 TO 40) PRESENTATION TITLES and MUSIC carry OVER: 9A. MONTAGE: We travel with Chris and his Datsun through the towns and open highways, landscapes and landmarks, days and nights, that lead to the Mojave desert in the West. (In contrast to his introspection of the previous night, Chris is buoyant throughout this sequence.)
S: EXT. DESERT, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN KINGMAN, ARIZONA AND LAS
N: VEGAS, NEVADA - SUNSET (CRANE SHOT) We see Chris stop the Datsun in the middle of the desert road. We (CRANE?) DOWN to a close-up through the windshield. Chris looks left. Then, right. Into the rearview mirror, and suddenly turns the wheel, veering the Datsun off the paved highway into the vast desert. As we CRANE back UP, the Datsun moves into the horizon.
T: END PRESENTATION TITLES. FADE MUSIC
S: EXT. DETRITAL WASH - TWILIGHT
N: ANGLE: WEST-FACING The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just before darkness slides over the desert. It is positioned at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl. ANGLE: EAST-FACING The Datsun, a yellow speck in the frame. Coyotes yap at the moon. Other than that, no sound on the desert floor. In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed. We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within. Short SERIES OF ANGLES as we MOVE IN on the distant gullies and ravines, starting to run with copious amounts of water.
S: INT. DATSUN - NIGHT
N: Chris McCandless, in the same clothes he had been in back in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the Datsun. His head supported by his backpack. We begin to HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to a deafening level. Chris awakens. As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun, momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright, disoriented. POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight, water has taken over the desert with a flash flood. However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water, while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the car settles into its new position below the cliff. He returns to sleep.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT - DAY
N: What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor. We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground. WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack. He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as much wilderness before us as we did behind. REPRISE MUSIC OVER MAIN TITLE: (INTO THE WILD) Chris walks into the distance. COMPLETE AND END MAIN TITLES.

D: This is Emory University freshman Chris McCandless reporting from the vault at Thompson Hall.
N: He indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a brightly lit corridor below.
C: CHRIS
D: We have just dynamited the hatchway and are the first human beings to step foot into this vault in over a hundred years. Somewhere in here lies the secret of the great beast within us all. A beast built on lies, corruption, and greed.
E: CONT'D
N: We HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris.
C: CHRIS
D: And there it is! The legendary beast Mocra.
E: CONT'D
N: CAMERA quickly PANS to a blanket-wrapped, crawling FELLOW STUDENT in a grotesque Halloween mask. We MOVE INTO CU on the monster growling. QUICK PAN back to Chris.
C: CHRIS
D: We've got to get out of here quick and re- secure the hatch while we make a plan of how to kill the beast.
E: CONT'D in mock fright
N: CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying to stay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down the hatchway into the University dorm corridor. CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT: Chris nailing the last nail in the hatchway from below. He climbs down the steps where he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off- camera source.

N: We HEAR the monster's GROWL from above.
C: CHRIS
D: - at least for the moment, in sealing the beast back into the vault. Your humble reporter, Chris McCandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this awful beast?
E: CONT'D
N: He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will he do? CONTINUE VIDEO: We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room as the office of Ted Turner.

N: A FELLOW STUDENT PLAYING TED TURNER with obvious fake mustache is locked into an episode of Matlock on his television set as our bold reporter, Chris, barges in.
C: CHRIS
D: Ted! We've got a monster in the vault. It represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all. I must slay it.
C: TED TURNER/STUDENT
D: McCandless, how many times have I had to tell you? I've had to tell you that you are a journalist and you can't get personally involved in your cases...or your stories.
E: worst acting we've ever seen
C: CHRIS
D: Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the only one who knows. You can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing! I look like some kind of an idiot.
C: TED TURNER/STUDENT
D: Do you know who you're talking to? I'm Ted Turner.
N: Behind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, a PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door.
C: PANICKED STUDENT
D: McCandless! You've got to hurry! The monster is scratching at the hatchway. He'll be out in no time.
C: TED TURNER/STUDENT
D: It'll mean your job, Chris McCandless.
E: threatening
C: CHRIS
D: That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed. Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNS WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of steps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board Chris had nailed.
E: to Ted
C: CHRIS
D: This is the only thing that can kill the monster. It's gonna be risky but without great risk, there is no freedom. So we will now hear from the famous singer - Chris McCandless.
E: CONT'D into camera
N: A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris. A YOUNG BLACK STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to play. Chris begins to serenade the monster, intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera as well. He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is The Night. CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway, slowly dying from the song being sung. As the song continues to be sung and the monster continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO TO SLO MO.
C: CARINE
D: When we were little, Chris was very to himself. He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends. He could be alone without being lonely. The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young. It seemed like they never fought without us. I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce. They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with. I cried my eyes out. But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce. Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money. Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik. And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge. By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us.
E: V.O. MORE
C: CARINE
D: I think this is when Chris began to see "careers" as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives. He'd begun planning to "slay the beast"...to make himself free.

A fly buzzes and lands, hanging upside down. The image is blurry. ECU: CHRIS' EYES Delirious in the heat, we WIDEN OUT to see that he's filthy (2 weeks of growth on his face and naked.)

N: The Forest Ranger bends over. Pops his flashlight through the tent door and peers around a bit before re- addressing Chris.
C: FOREST RANGER
D: You're not the character who knocked down our sign, are ya?
C: CHRIS
D: No.
E: giggles
C: FOREST RANGER
D: Because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only.
C: CHRIS
D: Well, I don't have a permit.
C: FOREST RANGER
D: No, I'm sure you don't. Listen, it looks like you've got your food secured pretty good, so I'm not gonna make you move on tonight. But, these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes. Next time, stop at the Rangers station and get yourself a permit.
C: CHRIS
D: Alright. I appreciate it. I'm gonna be headed towards the coast tomorrow.
C: FOREST RANGER
D: Be careful.
N: They shake hands and the Forest Ranger disappears into the thicket.

S: EXT. THE NORTHERN CREST - DAY
N: Chris descends the mountains where they meet the Redwoods. Every perilous step creates a mini landslide down the hill; dirt and gravel. Chris stops briefly to observe an over-flying commercial airliner.
C: CHRIS
D: Is that a man mommy? That's no mere man, sweetheart. That's Alexander SuperTramp! King of the wild frontier!
E: mocking imaginary conversation among passengers
N: Chris briefly waves to the airplane above and continues his descent.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR WILLOW CREEK (AUGUST 10, 1990)
N: A car slows to a stop.
S: INT./EXT. CAR-HIGHWAY
C: DRIVER
D: This is where I turn off.
C: CHRIS
D: Alright man. Thanks a lot.
N: Chris is dropped off. The driver veers off the highway and into the distance. Chris is left behind to hitch another ride.
S: 36A EXT. HIGHWAY 36A
N: CAMERA is across the road from Chris as one by one cars pass him by. He turns to move north by foot and we track with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to hitchhike with an extended thumb. Something catches his eye in the treeline beside the road. REVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As he lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat. He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris. With a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regard the police car. The POLICEMAN gets out of the car and moves to Chris.
C: POLICEMAN
D: How're you doin' this evening?
C: CHRIS
D: I'm alright. What's the matter?
E: reluctantly
C: POLICEMAN
D: You wanna put your backpack down on the hood of my car.
N: Chris does not oblige.
C: CHRIS
D: Why?
C: POLICEMAN
D: Because I asked you to, sir.
C: CHRIS
D: But I haven't done anything wrong. These are my personal items.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Do you know that it's unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway.
C: CHRIS
D: You're kidding.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop? We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here. And we've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers.
C: CHRIS
D: Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your car. You're in the traffic lane. And you can see, there's hardly any cars out here. Plus, it's a straight road; you can see for a long ways.
E: MORE
C: CHRIS
D: There's really been accidents along here?
E: CONT'D in disbelief
C: POLICEMAN
D: May I see some identification?
N: Now Chris is worried.
C: CHRIS
D: I don't have any.
C: POLICEMAN
D: You don't have any identification?
N: Chris shakes his head "No."
C: POLICEMAN
D: Well, I'm gonna site you for unlawful hitchhiking. You don't have to appear. You can send a check directly to the Humboldt County Clerks Office for restitution. If you don't pay it within 30 days, you're subject to fine and warrant. I'm gonna trust that you're gonna give me accurate information. What's your name?
E: CONT'D pulling out a ticket
N: Chris can't bring himself to lie.
C: CHRIS
D: McCandless. Christopher Johnson McCandless.
E: a beat
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (MID-AUGUST 1990)
N: Walt, Billie, and Carine sit around the kitchen table in August. A copy of Chris' ticket has been sent to the Annandale address and sits before them. Billie and Carine sit silently. Walt's on the phone.
C: CARINE
D: If Chris were trying to disappear, it would have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his real place of residence. Though my parents had already contacted the Annandale police with their initial concerns, this ticket arriving from California made them frantic.
E: V.O. MORE
C: CARINE
D: My father called one of his old government friends who put him in touch with a private investigator, someone who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA. Using the Willow Creek ticket as a starting point, the investigator began chasing down leads. Most of them led far afield -- to Europe and South Africa. Ultimately turning up nothing. What my dad couldn't believe was that he'd given up his car. He seemed to love that Datsun so much. It sounded just like Chris to me, though. He was very much of the school that you should own nothing except what you could carry on your back at a dead run.

S: EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY, NEAR ORICK, 60 MILES
N: SOUTH OF THE OREGON LINE - DAY (MID-AUGUST 1990) With his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his goofy new hat onto his head, we find Chris at a "dead run" to catch a ride that had overshot him. (Director's note: Don't leave this image too soon.) An old van idles waiting for him. As he gets to the passenger side, the woman passenger gets out. This is JAN BURRES, early 40's, looks to be still on the long road home from Woodstock. A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot of premature grey in it. Jan moving to the side door.
C: JAN
D: Hi. We just barely saw you there, under that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't back up - the van's reverse is broken.
C: CHRIS
D: Oh. That's okay. Thanks for stopping.
E: as Jan fiddles with side door handle
C: JAN
D: This door's a little tricky, I'll get it.
N: And with a little pulling, it opens. Indicating the pony- tailed and bearded driver (RAINEY), early 50's, definitely Woodstock...
C: JAN
D: Hop in, that's Rainey.
E: CONT'D
C: RAINEY
D: Hey, I'm Rainey.
C: JAN
D: And I'm Jan.
C: CHRIS
D: Hey, Rainey. Hi Jan. I'm Alex.
C: RAINEY
D: Alex of the hat.
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah.
E: closing the side door
N: Jan jumps back in passenger seat and the van rolls on.
S: INT. RAINEY & JAN VAN
N: 3-SHOT - CHRIS BETWEEN THEM IN THE BACKSEAT.
C: RAINEY
D: Were you out there a long time hitching?
C: CHRIS
D: Couple of days. But sometimes I forget to put my thumb out.
C: JAN
D: Probably, the rest of the time, that hat scares `em away.
N: Chris checks himself in the rearview mirror and gets a kick out of what he sees (That hat's staying on.) Jan is looking at the rearview mirror too, observing Chris with mild concern.
C: JAN
D: When's the last time you ate something?
E: CONT'D
N: Chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants he's collected.
C: CHRIS
D: See that? I've got this book and it shows you all the plants and berries that are edible. You can find things wherever you go.
E: excited
N: Jan steals a glance to Rainey. He's hip.
C: RAINEY
D: We were just in town getting some beads and stuff. Jan does handicrafts, so we're usually going from one swap meet to another. She's so good at what she does, we sold everything. So, we set up camp at Orick Beach. You're welcome to camp there with us.
C: JAN
D: And eat there with us.
N: Chris is beaming at the thought of real food.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - NIGHT
N: Chris, Jan, and Rainey are beside a campfire, sitting on blankets. Their tents loom behind them. Jan is weaving some sort of craft art. Chris is chomping on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.
C: CHRIS
D: So, I just left the car. It was a great car too. I'd driven it cross country the first time when I got out of high school. I had some really great adventures with it. That thing would just go and go. I mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it, it would've lasted me forever.
E: between large swallows
C: RAINEY
D: So, you're a leather now.
C: CHRIS
D: I'm a leather?
N: Rainey nods, smiling.
C: CHRIS
D: What's a leather?
E: CONT'D looking to Jan
C: JAN
D: You're a leather tramp. That's what they call the ones that hoof it on foot. So, we're technically rubber tramps.
C: RAINEY
D: As we have a vee-hi-cle.
E: interjecting
N: Rainey makes a move to put his arm around Jan. She goes a little stiff and fends it off. Chris notices.
C: JAN
D: Alex could have a vehicle. If he didn't burn his money. Why would you want to do that?
C: CHRIS
D: I don't need money. It makes people cautious.
C: JAN
D: Well, you have to be a little cautious Alex. That book of yours is all well and fine but you can't depend entirely on leaves and berries.
E: a little irritated
C: CHRIS
D: I don't know if you'd want to depend on much more than that.
C: JAN
D: Where's your mom and dad?
C: CHRIS
D: Makin' their money somewhere.
C: JAN
D: Come on Chris. You look like a loved * kid. Be fair. *
C: CHRIS
D: Fair?
C: JAN
D: You know what I mean.
C: CHRIS
D: I'll paraphrase Thoreau -- "Rather than * love, than money, than fairness, give me * truth." *
N: RAINEY * You look like shit. There's the truth. * They all laugh. *

S: INT. CHRIS' TENT, ORICK BEACH - LATER
N: Chris sits up reading, his tent entry flap ajar to let the small candle lantern ventilate. OS we HEAR a ZIPPING SOUND. It's Rainey. We see him from Chris' POV coming out of his tent deep in thought. As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood into the center of the fire. The tapping is slow and thoughtful. Micro-embers float upward into the night. Chris' tent flap closes by his own hand. ANGLE: Chris' dog-ears his book and puts out the lantern.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ORICK BEACH - DAY
N: We see Chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above the beach. He's got it tied to his back and his front. If we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging himself. Chris' POV: The rocks beside the water's edge. We see Rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea. We follow Chris' gaze to Jan, some fifty yards down the beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction of Rainey. ANGLE: Rainey at the water's edge. Chris appears beside him.
C: RAINEY
D: Geez. If I struck a match to you, I'd have warmth and dinner at the same time.
E: regarding Chris wrapped up in wood
N: But Rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.
C: CHRIS
D: Where's Jan going?
C: RAINEY
D: Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.
N: Chris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine that binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside Rainey.
C: RAINEY
D: You're an industrious little fucker, aren't ya... Yeah, it's funny how things happen at particular times. I've loved that woman for a lot of years. But you know, she's got a...story. We've been going through this thing real quietly cause, well...So, after running into you last night, this thing we were going through quietly, she started talking about. You know what I mean?
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: I think so.
C: RAINEY
D: You think what?
N: Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.
C: CHRIS
D: I think she's probably quietly disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to her to be close to you if there's a hole of some kind somewhere else.
C: RAINEY
D: That's a helluva insight. Jesus!... You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna walk on that water and get her back for me?
C: CHRIS
D: Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.
N: Rainey gives him a sideways glance.
C: CHRIS
D: It's true. But it's something I've got to get over sometime.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: CHRIS
D: So, I'll swim in it if you'll carry the firewood back to the campsite.
E: CONT'D
C: RAINEY
D: I'll carry. Shit-yes I'll carry.
N: And with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan. Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean, splashing and laughing. ANGLE: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his old lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and heads to the campsite. ANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having a ball. Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re- surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face.
T: TIME CUT:
S: EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - LATER
N: Through a burning campfire in the late afternoon, we see the chilly bodies of Chris and Jan carrying their clothes run shivering toward us. Rainey sits beside the campfire.
C: RAINEY
D: I thought you guys might need a little heat.
N: Jan smiles appreciatively.
C: JAN
D: That's not hot enough. Put your arms around me.
E: moving to Rainey
N: As they embrace, Chris throws a coat on from his tent, puts on his funny straw hat, and grabs a book. Rainey has wrapped a blanket around Jan and they sit beside the fire.
C: CHRIS
D: I'm going to go down the beach a ways and read a little bit. I'll bring the rest of that wood back before nightfall.
C: RAINEY
D: Alright. We might take a run into town to grab some food for tonight.
C: CHRIS
D: Sounds good.
N: He heads off down the beach.

N: MUSIC OVER: 1. The ocean moving toward sunset. 2. Seagulls, gliding inches over the water. 3. The breeze on the sea grass. 4. Chris in his big hat reading at water's edge. 5. Jan and Rainey deeply engaged in conversation beside the fire. 6. Chris closing his book, remaining meditative at water's edge. 7. Jan and Rainey in town, buying groceries and being playful with each other. 8. OVER Chris' shoulder, the sun sets and day becomes night.

C: RAINEY
D: Oh yeah.
N: Rainey takes a toke on the joint.
C: RAINEY
D: You'd like that if you're still on the road. Lot of fellow travelers.
E: CONT'D
N: Rainey offers the joint to Chris. Chris passes it up with a hand gesture.
C: CHRIS
D: What is that? The Slabs?
C: RAINEY
D: It's down in Niland, California. You know where the Salton Sea is?
C: CHRIS
D: Near San Diego, yeah?
C: RAINEY
D: Well about 200 miles Northeast of there, but yeah. Niland's off the east shore of Salton. Wild place. The navy bulldozed and abandoned a base there. All that's left is a grid of concrete foundations. They're scattered over about a square mile or so.
C: JAN
D: When the weather turns cold across the rest of the country, people show up there by the thousands: snow birds...
C: RAINEY
D: Drifters...
C: JAN
D: Sundry vagabonds...
N: RAINEY / JAN Like ourselves.
C: JAN
D: Livin' on the cheap under the sun.
C: CHRIS
D: You sell your handcrafts there?
C: JAN
D: Oh yeah. And a lot of second-hand goods. There's a swap meet. The people are cool. There's even some kids running around sometimes. Most everyone there, if they're not avoiding the cold, are at least dodging the IRS.
C: RAINEY
D: Or the FBI. CIA! DDT!!!
N: The three of them laugh.
C: JAN
D: It's good. You should check it out. If you come, I'll make a proper hat for you. Well, Alex. I'm gonna clean up and the old man and I are gonna get some rest. Looks like you got yourself a good bag there.
E: standing, shaking out her blanket indicating the sleeping bag
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah...my mother made it from a kit.
N: Jan sees an almost imperceptible mother pang in Chris, but he pushes it away quickly.

S: EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - LATER
N: The fire is burning low. Chris reads from Thoreau's WALDEN from the chapter on "Higher Laws" as we move slowly in toward him, we begin to HEAR quiet sounds of what may be love-making coming from Rainey and Jan's tent. A gentle smile comes over Chris' face and in its irony, he looks to the page before him. Chris' sliding fingertip underlines the following passage: Chastity is the flowering of a man; and what are called genius, heroism, holiness, and the like, are but various fruits which succeed it.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - MORNING
N: Gulls pierce into the grey morning ocean, snapping from schools of fish. And the subtle crackling of a campfire's death. There on the beach, Jan and Rainey's van, their tent, and the fireless coals of last night. But no sign of Chris, his bag or his tent. Jan appears from her tent, rubbing her eyes. She wears a sarong which she re-secures at the breast, then notices that Chris has left. But where his tent had been, the words: THANK YOU JAN AND RAINEY are spelled out in the sand with bits of driftwood. CU: Jan - We see her sadness. Rainey appears at her shoulder. He understands what is inside his woman.

C: CARINE
D: In early September, mom and dad got a call from the Annandale police notifying them that Chris' abandoned car had been identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol after a group of rare flower hunters stumbled upon it in the desert. There were no signs that Chris had intended to return to it. But there wasn't any evidence of struggle. The police said they thought Chris had chosen to leave it behind and not that it had been taken from him. Nonetheless, the initial comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly turned to their realization that Chris was actually trying not to be found.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK
N: We see Walt. He walks out the door of his house into the street. He keeps walking. And we go with him in his silent but internal Armageddon. We PULL him in CU throughout all that follows...(Refer to SCENE 171: "Dad calls it `suspended animation.'" This may affect our visual approach)
C: CARINE
D: The year Chris graduated high school he bought the Datsun, used. He wanted to drive it cross-country and visit our old neighborhood in California. The day before he left was my dad's birthday. Chris made a speech...
S: INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (PAST)
N: Chris stands beside the family piano, speaking to a party of his parent's friends, Walt and Billie among them. Beside him, a large gift-wrapped present. Carine sits at the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watching her brother with a hint of concern.
C: CHRIS
D: Dad, you and I have had our differences over the years...but on your birthday I want to tell you how grateful I am for all the things you've given me. And that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to support us kids. So, in return, I've been busting my ass a bit...at Domino's Pizza -
E: a little drunk, a little emotional
N: Chris moves to the gift.
C: CHRIS
D: and I've gotten you this token, this damned expensive token, as a token of that appreciation.
E: CONT'D
N: Chris holds the large gift toward Walt. Walt moves through his friends to Chris and strips the paper, exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope.
C: WALT
D: Would you look at that. Walt holds the telescope up for all to see. And the party responds with applause.
E: patting his son the back
N: Chris walks through the cheering family friends to take his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps.
C: CARINE
D: Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink.
C: CHRIS
D: Too much and not enough. I used to believe all that stuff. That whole story. I thought maybe if I said it again, I'd believe it. But I don't.
N: Tears have come to Chris' eyes. He puts his head in his hands. Carine puts an arm around him. BACK TO:
S: EXT ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK
N: PRESENT: Walt expressionless, walking into camera.
C: CARINE
D: The day after the party, Chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer. It was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin. As soon as I heard he was home, I ran into his room to talk to him. In California, he'd looked up some old family friends who still lived there. He'd found out that long after he had been born, our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife Marcia in secret.
E: V.O.
S: EXT CUT BANK, MONTANA - SUNSET
N: BRIEF CUTAWAY to Chris hitching on the Montana highway.
C: CARINE
D: And that one lie had led to another. That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia. Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time. And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children.
N: BACK TO:
S: EXT ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK
N: Walt.
C: CARINE
D: Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused. And mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress, became his accomplice.

D: She and my dad had decided to bend the truth about this other child saying that dad wasn't the father and they maintained that their fraudulent marriage was real.
E: CONT'D MORE
N: 39A.
C: CARINE
D: Chris was quiet when he told me this. He said it made his "entire childhood seem like a fiction"; that "the truth had been dying everyday." If something bothered Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself. And he made me promise to do the same.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: CARINE
D: He never did tell mom and dad that he knew. But Chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code. He loathed what he considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance. Chris submitted to dad's authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole time. It was inevitable that Chris would rebel. And when he did, he did it with characteristic immoderation.
E: CONT'D
N: Walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless light of dusk.
C: CARINE
D: My father is a brilliant man. But he had made some terrible mistakes. And to some extent, it seemed Chris was making him pay an awful price.

S: EXT. CUT BANK, MONTANA (SEPTEMBER 10, 1990)
N: A pick-up truck pulls over for Chris. As Chris jumps in, we see on the passenger side door, the name WAYNE WESTERBERG boldly painted across it. Chris hops in beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulders and a black goatee.
C: WAYNE
D: How're you doing? Wayne Westerberg.
E: rolling a cigarette without moving forward with the truck, his knees rattling up and down
C: CHRIS
D: Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless.
E: shaking hands
C: WAYNE
D: Seems like every time I come on this road, there's somebody hitching out here who looks as skinny and unfed as you.
N: Chris nods with a laugh. Wayne continuing...
C: WAYNE
D: Look, I gotta stop in Ethridge to drop something off
E: CONT'D know what I mean?
N: Chris is not sure about the "drop something off" part.
C: WAYNE
D: How `bout you and I grab something to eat down there?
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you.
C: WAYNE
D: How long has it been since you've had anything to eat?
C: CHRIS
D: Couple of days. I kinda ran out of money.
C: WAYNE
D: Well, there's no choice about it. I'm gonna get you some dinner.
N: Wayne lights his cigarette, puts the truck in gear and they head down the road. As the sun dips behind the horizon we TILT UP off the departing truck to the sky. Ominously mounting clouds stunningly reflect the red rays of the hidden sun:
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SUNBURST - NIGHT
N: Wayne's truck cuts through a track in a wheat field moving toward a compound of three trailers, one a double- wide, the other two on wheels, smaller. Beside them, a Wyeth-esque farmhouse. He eases the engine and comes to a stop in front of the double-wide. As he and Chris dismount the truck, Wayne gives him a hushing finger across the lips. They tip-toe up to the door, where Wayne shuffles a bunch of keys. A little thunder kicking in the distant sky. 41A.
S: 56A INT. DOUBLE-WIDE - NIGHT 56A
N: As Wayne and Chris enter, they tip-toe over empty booze bottles and passed out work crew; Wayne's harvesting team. They make their way to a small table in the kitchenette. Remains of the evening's dinner are on the stove. Wayne turns on the stovetop coils to heat it up.
C: WAYNE
D: So where is it you're headed?
C: CHRIS
D: I was thinking about doubling back through the Canadian side of Glacier Park.
C: WAYNE
D: Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who'd go there, camp on the Black Feet Res. She was into all that American Indian stuff.

C: WAYNE
D: I can bring you to the border at Sweet Grass once you've had some food.
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Well, that'd be great. What do you do out here?
C: WAYNE
D: Well, I do a lot of things. Computer programming. Video game repair. I'm a licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in Carthage and another one a few miles out of town. But in the summertime I run a combine crew, follow the harvest from Texas way the hell north to the Canadian border. We just got done cutting barley for Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I got this little black box deal on the side
E: You know what I mean?
C: CHRIS
D: You mean those free satellite TV deals?
C: WAYNE
D: You said it, not me.
E: as though he hadn't brought it up
N: Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains. Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated food. As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind rocks the trailer.
C: WAYNE
E: CONT'D smiling, responding to wind
C: OOOOOOH.
D: Chris doesn't respond, digs into the food. Points to the unconscious tribe splayed out. SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING UNCONSCIOUS BODIES.
C: CHRIS
D: Who are these guys?
N: Wayne gets a little giggle.
C: WAYNE
D: Those are my Hudderites. Agriculture's a pretty transient business. These guys come off the Hudderite colony looking for work. I always got work for people. Then that guy -
E: MORE
N: 42A.
C: WAYNE
D: That's Kevin. He's with me most of the time. He's not a Hudderite. He's from Madison.
E: CONT'D pointing at guy making most of his snore

D: Madison. Okay.
N: Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding the trailer shell. A couple hits of lightning follow.

D: Listen, you don't want to go out there on the road tonight. Why don't you just roll your sleeping bag out and play like a Hudderite until morning.
N: Chris looks about. There's not much room but it beats the pelting outside.
C: CHRIS
D: Thanks Wayne. I will.
T: TIME CUT:
N: Chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag between a Hudderite and the sleeping KEVIN. Wayne comes from the back bedroom, tip-toes through the sleeping bodies to hand Chris a pillow.
C: WAYNE
D: Get a good sleep. See you in the morning.
N: Chris waves a thanks, puts the pillow beneath his head and closes his eyes.
S: EXT. SUNBURST - DAY
N: We are TIGHT on Chris' hand atop the shifter of one of Wayne's lumbering harvesters.
C: WAYNE
D: Okay. Now take hold of the joystick, get the feel of header, idle it down with the toggle switch...
E: O.S
N: As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos. WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine. In the background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe blond grain. Chris tries his hand at the shifter once more. This time the thing starts to move.
C: WAYNE
D: That's it. That's it. Now take it on out and make yourself some money.
E: CONT'D
N: Wayne jumps off the combine and Chris begins to cut his pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter. Wayne laughs his ass off.
S: EXT SUNBURST - DAY
N: SERIES OF SHOTS indicating a SERIES OF DAYS passing as Chris gets a hang of the machines a little more at a time.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DOUBLE-WIDE, SUNBURST - NIGHT
N: Six men including Wayne and Chris, two among them - Hudderites, crowd in to the small dinner area of the trailer. Talking politics and bullshit, and eating a welcome meal.
C: WAYNE
D: I'm gonna break out some whiskey. Alex, you want anything other than that beer?
C: CHRIS
D: I'd take a White Russian if you've got it.
N: The group of men laugh at the youngster's order of a fancy drink. MAN #1 What are you Alex, a Commie?
C: CHRIS
D: No, I just like White Russians.
C: WAYNE
D: I haven't got anything like that here. But I tell ya what. And I know I speak for everybody. You wanna come work with us in Carthage, we'll hook you up on the grain elevator and get you a White Russian down at the Cabaret.
C: CHRIS
D: Really?

N: MAGIC HOUR. TELEPHOTO LENS. The harvesting convoy rolls toward us like a herd of mammoths. 44A-45.
S: EXT. CARTHAGE - NIGHT (LATE SEPTEMBER 1990)
N: A series of silent, quaint establishing tableaus. (Director's Note: Condor above street) It's a sleepy little town. Population: 274. Cluster of clapboard houses, tiny yards, and weathered brick storefronts rising humbly from the immensity of the northern plains. Stately rows of cottonwoods shade a grid of streets, seldom disturbed by moving vehicles. From UNDER CAMERA, the series of tableaus is interrupted as the convoy roars into our frame from BENEATH CAMERA.

N: Wayne opens the door at the top of the stairs.
S: INT. CHRIS' ROOM, WESTERBERG'S CARTHAGE HOME - SAME
N: Wayne plops Chris' pack beside a single bed in the tiny but comfortable room. Chris enters, very happy with his new quarters.
C: WAYNE
D: Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you can beat the rest of the boys to it. But you do want to grab a shower cause we're all heading over to the Cabaret in exactly thirty-six minutes. So, get your dancing shoes on. There's foo-foo in the medicine cabinet. I think it's Brut. Then you want to put your charm in overdrive cause we like to PAH-TAY!
E: slaps his own face as if he's putting on cologne
N: Wayne gives Chris a wink and exits, shutting the door behind him. Chris takes in his new surroundings. He's on a work crew and he likes it. Chris makes the move for the shower but by the time he opens his door to the hall, all the other crew members are barreling up the stairs in front of them, clamoring for dibs (Chris' POV) MAN #1 I got first! MAN #2 (in a kid voice) You had first last night! MAN #1 (entering the bathroom) Well, if you wanna wash my back, cowboy... MAN #2 You go ahead, fairy. Just don't use all the soap. ANGLE: Chris.

N: The Jack Daniels is flowing. Wayne's crew drinks, smokes, and strikes out with every fat woman in the place. GAIL BORAH, an on-again, off-again girlfriend of Wayne's tends bar. A petite sad-eyed woman, slight as a heron, delicate features and long blond hair. Wayne and Chris sit at the end of the bar.
C: WAYNE
D: Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to go to for that White Russian you've been wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can be hazardous.

D: Shut up, Wayne. You want a White Russian, sweetie?

E: CONT'D

D: I'm thinking about going to Alaska.
C: WAYNE
D: Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska? The city Alaska does have markets.
C: CHRIS
D: No, Alaska, Alaska. I want to be all the way out there. On my own. No map. No watch. No axe. Just out there. Big mountains, rivers, sky. Game. Just be out there in it. In the wild.
E: with a drunken, excited energy
C: WAYNE
D: In the wild.
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah. Maybe write a book about my travels. About getting out of this sick society.
C: WAYNE
D: Society, right.
E: coughing
C: CHRIS
D: Because you know what I don't understand? I don't understand why, why people are so bad to each other, so often. It just doesn't make any sense to me. Judgement. Control. All that.
C: WAYNE
D: Who "people" we talking about?
C: CHRIS
D: You know, parents and hypocrites. Politicians and pricks.
N: Chris is clearly troubled by his own words. Wayne leans into Chris.
C: WAYNE
D: This is a mistake. It's a mistake to get too deep into that kind of stuff. Alex, you're a helluva young guy, but I promise you this: You're a young guy. Blood and fire! You're juggling blood and fire!
E: tapping a long finger against Chris' forehead
C: GAIL
D: Who are you to be giving advice to anybody?
E: chimes in

E: CONT'D mock opening his zipper, in a high-pitched voice
N: On the television above the bar appears Reverend Jesse Jackson. We can't hear him but we can see him. Chris points at the television and yells out to the entire bar of cowboys and ranch hands -

T: TIME CUT:
S: EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY - LUNCH BREAK
N: While Wayne and most of the crew get a little rest in the shade of the grain elevator and eat their lunches, Chris and Kevin are deep in a bald patch in the field. Kevin is taking Chris through the paces of smoking and curing meat in the wilds. Chris listens and takes notes. (Director's note: Cast a "Kevin" who knows this shit and shoot it as a dialogue scene as well as a silent tableau.)
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CABARET BAR, CARTHAGE - NIGHT
N: The place is packed and Chris is taking over the piano, surprising everyone with a tremendous talent. Segueing from honky-tonk country to ragtime, he's become the life of the party. The MUSIC continues OVER:
S: EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY
N: All the men of Wayne's crew (who by now we've come to know) and Chris are working their asses off. POST LAP MUSIC FADES OUT as we: INTERCUT the crew at work with a SERIES OF MYSTERY ANGLES: Tires kicking up dust on dirt roads, through town, and into the field behind the grain elevator. Back to the work, back to the tires. Back to the work, back to these several cars hauling ass through the field. Back to Wayne, up high in the grain elevator -
C: WAYNE
D: I gotta take a piss.
E: to Chris, as he lowers himself down the man-lift
N: Chris' POV: from high in the grain elevator. He watches Wayne below, as Wayne saunters out to the field to take a piss. With his back to us, Wayne whips it out and starts pissing about 25 yards from the grain elevator. CU Wayne. He looks up from his urination, the grain elevator behind him. We see a slight mischievous smile come to his face. He puts his hands up into the air when suddenly - Six unmarked FBI vehicles surround him. (Director's note: Triangulate three long lenses on Wayne as the mysterious cars enter each frame, as they skid to a dusty stop on all sides of him.) Chris and the men of his crew look on. MAN #1 I warned him about those little black boxes. As Wayne is handcuffed and led away, he nods up to his boys.
C: WAYNE
D: You wanna get that zipper for me? Sorry boys. Gonna have to shut down for a while. Alex! You come back and work for me anytime. Gail's got all your checks, guys. I shouldn't be away too long.
E: to arresting agent and then calling out to his crew to Chris and the men
N: With that, the FBI agents have hustled the good-natured Wayne into the back of one of the cars. As they take off into the distance, we move in on Chris, bemused.

C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to Alaska, at least so I can get settled up there in decent weather.
C: GAIL
D: South. You want to go south. You want me to take you out to the highway?
C: CHRIS
D: Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out. He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his backpack, and gives Gail a hug.
E: putting on his cowboy
C: GAIL
D: You take care of yourself now, Alex. You got a whole family here depending on it.

N: We HEAR passing cars humming above. Chris has set up camp and he's digging in the dirt. He buries many of his belongings. He makes sure he's got his check from working with Wayne in his pocket. He packs only the essential items, burying all else. He gets into his sleeping bag and goes to sleep.

C: GREEN SUIT
D: "To launch out of?" What's your experience level?
C: CHRIS
D: Not much.
C: GREEN SUIT
D: Any? Do you have a permit?
C: CHRIS
D: A permit for what?
C: GREEN SUIT
D: You can't paddle down the river without a permit. If you like, you can apply for one here, get yourself some experience, and I'll put you on the wait-list.
C: CHRIS
D: Wait-list? To paddle down a river?
C: GREEN SUIT
D: That's right.

D: Twelve years?
E: laughing
C: GREEN SUIT

N: The Green Suit eyes Chris' departure with suspicion.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COLORADO RIVER - DAY
N: Chris stands beside a dramatic section of rapids. The whitewater roars. As we SLOWLY ZOOM INTO Chris' face, terrified and absorbed by the torrent, a bead of sweat drops across his forehead, TILTS OUR CAMERA to his trembling hands and legs, when Peter Gabriel's I Have The Touch begins to play. BACK TO: ZOOM INTO Chris' face...a decision: Fear becomes determination We SMASH CUT ON CUE with Peter Gabriel's vocals. SLO MO, SUPER DRAMATIC - Chris blasting out of a shoot in the rapids in the kayak we saw the night before. It's outrageous. Hair-raising. Just like Peter Gabriel sings it, he has the touch. This kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on rapids. But it's that immortal stage of life, no care, no helmet, no life-jacket, pure adrenaline. He can hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's no looking back now. And with every thump of the music, we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration. With the culmination of the music, Chris has successfully shot the rapid. He paddles through quiet waters. We move in on him as he maneuvers the kayak to face upstream. There before him, the impossible rapid he had just completed.
C: CHRIS
D: I'm Superman. SuperTramp.
E: to himself
N: He feels immortal. He makes his about-face and is about to head down stream when he sees at the river's edge, a group of RIVER TOURISTS and their GUIDE lunching beside a pontoon raft. The tourists look like a bunch of bewildered tubby-troopers in their misfitted orange life- vests and cereal bowl helmets. The RIVER GUIDE yells out at Chris as Chris moves PAST CAMERA and away. The guide gets on his satellite phone to alert the Rangers. We ZOOM SLOWLY away from them toward the rapid.

S: EXT. ANOTHER QUIET SECTION OF RIVER - LATER
N: Phillip Glass' Cloudscape plays OVER: Chris paddles on. LOW ANGLE: It is a narrow gorge of solid rock, looking up from hundreds of feet below the canyon crest.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FURTHER ALONG THE RIVER - LATER
N: The canyon has widened to beach-like banks. Music FADES. Along the banks he sees a YOUNG BLONDE COUPLE. This is MADS and SONJA, in their 20's, Danish. They play at the river's edge beside their campsite, hotdogs cooking on a Hibachi. Chris averts his eyes when Sonja rises from the water, topless.
C: MADS
D: Hello!
E: yelling out to Chris
C: CHRIS
D: Hello.
C: MADS
D: You can join us!
N: Chris doesn't know quite what to do. But Mads seems quite comfortable inviting a stranger into the presence of his topless girlfriend.
C: MADS
D: We have hotdogs!
E: CONT'D
N: Chris - can't turn that down! He paddles to within feet of the water's edge.
C: MADS
D: I am Mads.
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Hi. Alex.
C: SONJA
D: I am Sonja.
N: Chris gives Sonja a little wave. She bypasses it, wading up to the Kayak, giving him a big hug.
C: SONJA
D: Hello Alex.
E: CONT'D
N: This couple is extremely energetic. Can't wait to please. And a bona fide American adventurer in their midst. It's everything they could've wanted.
C: MADS
D: We are from Copenhagen. And you are from the rapids.
C: CHRIS
D: I am.
C: SONJA
D: My Got!
C: MADS
D: Crazy man. You're a crazy man! Sonja, he is a crazy man. I'll make you a hotdog.
E: to Chris
N: Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi.
C: MADS
D: Just one minute. One minute...
E: CONT'D
N: Sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry T-shirt. But as she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keep saying Hello. Chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off his face in the presence of these warm, open people.
C: MADS
D: I love this. Don't you love this? This is nature. We see it in the American movies. How come you're crazy?
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Well...
C: MADS
D: Because that's crazy! You come down the rapids. What do you want on your hotdog? Mustard and relish?
E: interrupting
C: CHRIS
D: You have ketchup?
C: MADS
D: No, I have mustard and relish.
C: CHRIS
D: Mustard and relish it is then.
C: MADS
D: Sonja, you want a hotdog?
C: SONJA
D: Of course I want a hotdog. Why are you stupid?
E: in Danish
N: Mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill.
C: MADS
D: She asked me why I'm stupid. And I say, well...like I ask you why you're crazy and you say "well." Where are you going?
E: translating
C: CHRIS
D: I haven't decided.
C: MADS
D: We like it here very much. We went to Los Angeles. And then, we went to Las Vegas.
C: SONJA
D: Las Vegas is very nice. The universe is very good.
N: 59A.
C: MADS
D: And then, we come here. Maybe you go to Mexico.
E: MORE
C: MADS
D: You can take kayak around Lake Mead and then take the river down to Mexico.
E: CONT'D
N: Chris likes the idea.
C: CHRIS
D: How far are we from Lake Mead?
C: MADS
D: Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam?
N: Sonja grabs a map from the tent, opens and scrutinizes it. We follow her finger tracing the river.
C: SONJA
D: Maybe three hundred thirty kilometers...like two hundred miles.
N: Sonja walks the map over to Chris at water's edge and hands it to him. He studies it.
C: CHRIS
D: Man, I wonder if I could go all the way down into the Gulf of California.
N: Chris traces his finger along the impossibly long route leading to El Golfo de Santa Clara.
C: MADS
D: I go with you. We leave Sonja here. You and me in kayak - we go to Mexico.
E: entering the water with Chris' hotdog
C: SONJA
D: You're embarrassing. Idiot. Mads with a burst of re-exhilaration, grabs Chris' hand, shaking it violently.
E: in Danish
C: MADS
D: I like the meeting you.
C: CHRIS
D: Thank you. I'm very happy to meet both of you too.
N: Sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her T-shirt off on the move. Chris is about to bust a gut. Sonja returns to her sunbathing. These two are a hoot. 60A. Just then, something catches Chris' attention upriver. We can just barely make out the SOUNDS of a jet boat motor. His eyes narrow a bit, then -
C: CHRIS
D: Well, guys I really appreciate the hospitality but I wanna make camp down- river a ways so I better take off before dark.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COLORADO RIVER - MOMENTS LATER
N: Chris, back in the kayak is paddling down river. Mads and Sonja on the bank, wave a boisterous goodbye. And they just keep waving. And Chris keeps waving until he has drifted out of sight, when around the upriver bend arrive the RIVER PATROL. At river's edge, Mads, thinking quickly, waves for their attention. Pointing the river patrol back upriver, he yells:
C: MADS
D: He went thattaway! The crazy man - he went thattaway!
N: And miraculously, the river patrol makes an about face and heads in the opposite direction of Chris. Suddenly Sonja thinks Mads is the most clever man on earth. As she jumps his bones right there on the river's edge -

D: Just like in the movies.

C: CARINE
D: It would be Christmas in a couple of months. And the last news we'd had was about his car being found. I woke up a couple of days ago, and for the first time, I was surprised to realize that it wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard from Chris. I wondered why he hadn't tried to call in case I might answer. He could've hung up if it wasn't me.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. COLORADO RIVER, TOPOCK, ARIZONA - DAY
N: Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak. This lower stretch of the river has little in common with the unbridled torrent that explodes through the Grand Canyon. Emasculated by dams and diversion canals, the lower Colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir, through some of the hottest, starkest, most austere country on the continent.
C: CARINE
D: But why he didn't send a letter, maybe through a friend. I got mad. But I told myself it was good. It made me remember that there was something more than rebellion, more than anger that was driving him. Chris had always been driven, had always been an adventurer. When he was four years old...

S: EXT. FISHING VILLAGE, EL GOLFO DE SANTA CLARA - DAY
N: We see Chris jump down off the back of the duck hunter's truck. He slides the kayak off the truck bed onto the street. Chris goes into his pocket, pulls out a sealed sandwich bag of cash. He tries to pay the hunters for their time but they refuse the money. Nonetheless, Chris is insistent and they relent. Chris pulls his backpack from inside the bow and saddles it up on his shoulders. The hunters pull away.
S: EXT. EL GOLFO DE SANTA CLARA
N: (1000mm lens) LOW ANGLE: SAND AND HEAT WAVES IN FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND: Chris, paddling his kayak toward us, seemingly in the sand dunes. As we BOOM UP SLIGHTLY, we see that there is a bend in the water's edge and that he is in fact, paddling in the crystalline blue of the Gulf.
C: CHRIS

N: See the ocean and sand, wind whipping them. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Chris in a cave where he has made camp; watching, waiting.

N: Chris sits with the IMMIGRATION OFFICER.
C: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
D: 36 days, wow. I guess they're gonna have to watch that spillway a little better.
C: CHRIS
D: What they ought to do is open up the dams and let the rivers flow.
C: IMMIGRATION OFFICER
D: I can't disagree with you on that. Okay, Alexander SuperTramp. I think we're gonna let you out of here shortly but you've got two working weeks to get an ID card in the United States. You can't be crossing these borders without identification, are we understood?
C: CHRIS
D: Yes, sir. I've eaten enough sand to send me back to the city anyway.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TRAIN YARD, SOMEWHERE NEAR ALGODONES - NIGHT
N: A freight train cranks up its great engines and starts its move west. Chris POV: We see a BULL (hobo slang for a railway security guard) making his rounds. As the bull disappears around the caboose, and the trains motion picks up, Chris appears from behind a fuel pump. He makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight cars, not quite sure how to board them. He begins to slowly jog beside the train. There is a vertical steel rod on each passing car. He times the train by putting his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it.
C: CHRIS
D: One...Two...Three -
E: counting
N: 71A. And with that he accelerates to a run, throws his pack into the moving freight car before him, simultaneously leaping up to grab the rail and throw himself into the car. But his left foot misses and he's suddenly dangling from the moving train. He grabs hand over hand on the rail. ANGLE: Dangling feet and razor sharp wheels. ANGLE: Chris. He puts everything into pulling himself up, growling the strength into his muscles finally...
S: INT. FREIGHT CAR - NIGHT
N: As Chris rolls forward into the car -- he made it!
C: CHRIS
D: As Alexander Supertramp returns to civilization...a hobo. I'm a for real hobo.
E: quietly
N: He's very happy about this (despite the near surrender of it.) Chris uses his pack as a pillow, lays back on it and begins to sing Roger Miller's King of the Road.
T: CUT TO:

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - EARLY EVENING (STILL LIGHT)
N: The streets are crowded with business people on their way to homes and happy hours, buses and parking garages, showers and comforts. Among the throngs, we find Chris walking up Grand Street, backpack on his shoulders. We find he is not such an unusual sight, there are homeless to the left and homeless to the right.

C: CHRIS
D: Can you tell me how to get an ID card?
C: SOCIAL WORKER
D: Did you lose your identification sir?
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah.
C: SOCIAL WORKER
D: No birth certificate? Nothing?
N: Chris shakes his head apologetically.
C: SOCIAL WORKER
D: Ouch. Alright. Well you're gonna have to work that out with the DMV. You can catch them in the morning.
E: CONT'D
N: The social worker begins to write an address on a piece of paper.
C: SOCIAL WORKER
D: The closest one is Montebello and we can help you with a bus voucher.
E: CONT'D
N: She hands the Montebello address to Chris.
C: SOCIAL WORKER
D: So, just come to this desk when you need the voucher.
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: And, if I want to apply for a job somewhere, can you help me with that?
C: SOCIAL WORKER
D: If you know how to cook, we might have a space for you in our mobile kitchen. But I'll have to talk to my supervisor about it in the morning.
C: CHRIS
D: Alright then. Thank you. Oh, one last thing. Do you have a bed for me?
C: SOCIAL WORKER
D: Sure. Just fill this in and I'll get you all set up.

S: INT. MIDNIGHT MISSION DORM, LOS ANGELES
N: Throughout the next two scenes, there is steady HONKING of CAR HORNS, WAILING of POLICE SIRENS, AMBIENT HOSTILE BANTER, GRINDING ENGINES OF BUSES, puffs of diesel exhaust choke us. 300 HOMELESS occupy nearly as many beds in the dorm. Chris searches the locker wall for his assigned locker. When he comes upon it, he double checks the number with that on the key, opens it, and puts his backpack inside. CU: The lock, as Chris closes and secures his locker.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - 6TH AND WALL - NIGHT
N: Chris walking among the hordes of homeless at 6th and Wall streets. Open fires burn in front of cardboard shacks. There are blacks, whites, Mexicans, even families with children, junkies, winos, hustlers, and hookers.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - BROADWAY - NIGHT
N: NEW ANGLE: Chris walking down Broadway. This is clearly just blocks away from where we last saw him, yet the atmosphere is as if of a different world. One of those downtown LA hip yuppie blocks. He comes upon a bar. Through the window Chris sees young men and women roughly his own age - working people, suits, gold-chainers. Metallica blares on the sound system.
T: CUT TO:

T: FADE OUT/IN:
S: EXT. TRAIN TRACKS OUTSIDE LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
N: Chris' train barrels along.
S: INT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
N: Chris goes into his pack, grabs his canteen and drinks some water. Mid-sip, the train begins to make a surprising stop. Screeching wheels on track. Chris is alarmed. As he moves to peer out the door, even before he has a chance to see what's coming -- WHAM! He's smashed in the head with a baton. A BULL jumps into the car with him. BULL #2 Lay down on your stomach, spread eagle! Chris turns to reason with the man. And that's all it takes -- six straight blows to the ribs, legs, and arms. We hear it more than we see it. Chris is in agony. BULL #2 (CONT'D) Let me see your face. The bull shines a flashlight into Chris' eyes. BULL #2 (CONT'D) I never, ever, ever forget a face. If I see yours again, I won't arrest you. I'll kill you. This is the god-damned railroad. And we will do whatever we have to, to keep you freeloaders from violating our liability. Chris is trying to understand what the man is saying. BULL #2 (CONT'D) If one of you people gets hurt on our train, we are liable. Do you understand that?
C: CHRIS
D: I'm sorry, sir.
E: despite the violent irony
N: BULL #2 You have I.D.?
C: CHRIS
D: No, sir.
N: BULL #2 Of course you don't.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT
N: Chris is pushed off the train, his pack thrown out after him. The bull jumps down beside the track as well and walks down track away from Chris, signalling an "all clear" with his flashlight to some unseen engineer. BULL #2 (to Chris over his shoulder) Last time, my friend. Chris stumbles to his feet. The pain of the beating is real. He bleeds from the back of his ear. But he can walk. And he does.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Chris sits on his pack on the roadside, hitchhiking and eating from a can of beans he opened with his pocketknife. The odd car passes but doesn't stop.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ARIZONA INTERSTATE OVERPASS - NIGHT
N: Chris hops out of a Camaro that gave him a ride. The lighting is anonymous and so is the driver.
C: CHRIS
D: Thanks very much.
N: He closes the door and the car drives off. We follow Chris as he goes to the overpass edge. He drops his pack over the side. Chris climbs down the edge of the overpass, grabs his pack, and scurries into the UNDERPASS below. (We suddenly recognize this as his pre-river run campsite) He digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his pack. Last to come out of the ground, Chris' copy of Jack London's Call of the Wild. He pulls off a temp wrapping and dusts it off. Chris lights his candle lantern and begins to read. O.S. VOICES from the PAST:

E: O.S. CONT'D
S: INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (PAST)
N: ELEVEN-YEAR OLD CARINE sits in the stairwell leading to her parent's room where an argument ensues. Carine's head in her hands, a delicate tear moistens the webs between her small fingers. FIFTEEN-YEAR OLD CHRIS enters from O.S. He leans against the stairwell and looks up the stairs. Our focus remains on Carine. In the B.G. SOFT FOCUS, Walt is pinning Billie down onto the bed. She flails at him but he holds down her shoulders.
C: WALT
D: LOOK WHAT YOUR MOTHER IS MAKING ME DO!
N: Billie slips his grasp. Walt reaches out with a hit/push of her back. She is thrust out of the bedroom onto the landing above the staircase followed by Walt who positions himself in the doorway like a hostile crucifixion.
C: WALT
D: I'll just cancel Christmas then!
E: CONT'D raging
N: Billie returns to him, punching on his chest:
C: BILLIE
D: Who do you think you are? God?
C: WALT
D: Yes. I'm God!
N: Chris puts his hand out to Carine. She looks up to him. He gives her a smile and a wink. She takes his hand and they exit frame as the argument continues.
C: WALT
D: Where do you kids think you're going?
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: BILLIE
D: Kids, get back here!
E: O.S. not in desperation so much as a demand for their witness
N: We HEAR a DOOR SLAM OC.

E: mockingly
N: 79A.
C: CARINE
D: Who do you think you are? God?
E: humored out of her sadness
C: CHRIS
D: Yes. I'm God.
S: EXT. ARIZONA INTERSTATE UNDERPASS - NIGHT
N: As they both laugh we DISSOLVE BACK to Chris (PRESENT) reading beside his candle lantern.
C: CARINE
D: In the nine months since Chris' disappearance, my parents went through enormous changes. Guilt was giving way to pain. And pain seemed to bring them closer. My father had humbled dramatically. And what had always been a sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man who actually thought he could cancel Christmas, had given way to the vulnerability of a father's heart. Even their faces had changed. It made me sad that I couldn't share with Chris the new closeness I felt toward our parents.
E: V.O.
N: The image of Chris reading begins a SLOW DISSOLVE INTO...
S: INT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
C: CARINE
D: I close my eyes at night sometimes and imagine where Chris might be.
N: Suspicious, ghostly faces briefly appear in the strobing lights that hit the train car from outside. They're toothless and tattooed. Aged and young. Punks and piercings. They're train tramps. We see Chris observing them. Warmly he speaks but we DO NOT HEAR, "I'm Alex."
S: EXT. TRAMP CAMP, LAS VEGAS - DAY
C: CARINE
D: Was there beauty around him? Was he hurt? Was he alone?
N: We see Chris sharing camp with the train tramps in the

C: CARINE
D: Was he having the great adventure that he wanted?
N: We see Chris working as a waiter in a Las Vegas
T: restaurant. DISSOLVE...
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY
C: CARINE
D: Could he feel the changes here at home? By some kind of supernatural osmosis? Chris once wrote to me from college saying he wanted to talk to me about all the problems he had with mom and dad.
N: We see what may be Chris' POV from a train car snaking through a mountain pass.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT - NIGHT

N: We see Chris in the Las Vegas desert by a campfire at night.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. SEATTLE - DAY
N: HIGH ANGLE CU: We see Chris walking the streets of Seattle. As we WIDEN OUT, he becomes a dot in the Seattle landscape.
C: CARINE
D: In those silent moments, with my eyes closed trying to picture where Chris might be at that very moment, probably climbing some scary mountain, I want to reach into that picture and bring him back to see what mom and dad, what our family might become.
N: LONG LENS: Chris disappears over the rise into the Seattle marketplace overlooking Puget Sound (per location photography.)
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ANNANDALE SUPERMARKET - DAY
C: CARINE
D: But instead when I open my eyes, what I see is my mother, sitting at the dining room table, sifting through photo albums and pictures of Chris. It's all she can do to examine the snapshots. And, though she breaks down from time to time, she studies them with a sort of hungry intensity - like looking at food you can't eat, or into a window at a family around a table that you were once a part of and can be no more.
N: We see Billie driving out of the Annandale supermarket onto the boulevard. She sees a hitchhiker roadside. She cranes her head - is it Chris? It's not.
C: CARINE
D: She convinces herself it's Chris; that it's her son, whenever she passes a stray. And I fear for the mother in her...
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BARREN DESERT - DAY
N: We see Chris hitchhiking in a barren desert.
C: CARINE
D: Instincts that seem to sense the threat of a loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure - I begin to wonder if I do understand what Chris is saying any longer. But I catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parents he grew up with. That in the forced reflection that comes with loss, indeed everything Chris is saying, has to be said. And I trust for him that everything he is doing has to be done. This is our life.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BULLHEAD CITY, ARIZONA - DAY (OCTOBER 1991)
N: Chris is in the passenger seat of a Mac truck cab. Both Chris and the TRUCKER look outward as though to find an address or landmark.
C: TRUCKER
D: I don't know where to drop you. Bullhead's kinda haphazard - there's no "center." You sure you don't want to be in Laughlin? It's casinos versus chiropractors.
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, no. This is good. Right here.
C: TRUCKER
D: Alright then. Chiropractors it is.
N: He pulls over. Chris grabs his pack and exits the truck in front of a laundromat. As the truck pulls away, Chris sees a "Help Wanted" sign for Burger King on the laundromat window.
T: TIME CUT:
S: INT. BURGER KING, BULLHEAD CITY - DAY
N: The place is packed with a line out the door. LORI, the second assistant manager, hurries back into the kitchen, where we find Chris in paper cap, bunning whoppers at a leisurely pace.
C: LORI
D: Chris, you gotta go faster. We've got a line out the door.
C: CHRIS
D: Okay.
E: a bit oblivious
N: But then just continues on at his leisurely daydreaming pace. Lori is about to say something but by now she knows there's no getting through to him. She looks down to the floor where we see that Chris wears no socks.
C: LORI
D: Chris, I don't mean to be on you about everything. You're doing a great job.
E: extending patience MORE
C: LORI
D: I want to keep you on. And we all want to help you get to Alaska, but you've got to start wearing socks.
E: CONT'D

N: The young teller giggles.

N: We're TIGHT ON Chris' sock-less feet, pedalling away from the bank on a bicycle. The growing independence of his financial situation felt in the MUSIC OVER: SERIES OF ANGLES as Chris rides out of town, into the desert, from a late afternoon sun into a sunset as he arrives at his -
S: EXT. CAMPSITE, OUTSIDE BULLHEAD CITY - SUNSET
N: The casino lights of Laughlin, Nevada distantly in B.G. Chris pedals up a dirt path to find many of his belongings strewn about. And in particular, some food supplies have been torn into. A coyote yips in the distance as Chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds. Across the desert, scurrying away beyond the tumbleweed, three young coyotes head for the hills. Chris picks up his tattered hat and smiles.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BURGER KING, BULLHEAD CITY - DAY
N: We are TIGHT on the PUNCHCLOCK as Chris' timecard comes into frame and is punched out. WIDEN OUT to see Chris taking off his paper hat and Burger King overshirt. He walks his timecard over to Lori. The place is all but empty.
C: CHRIS
D: Lori, I'm punching out.
C: LORI
D: Okay. Just put it in the drop.
C: CHRIS
D: No, I mean I'm punching out for good.
C: LORI
D: We've made our quota, have we?
E: happy for him
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah. Also, I've got to do some things before I head north.
C: LORI
D: Alright Chris. Well, we've enjoyed knowing you. I won't be able to get that last check to you right away though.

S: EXT. THE SLABS, NILAND, CA - DAY
N: This is the vista of former barracks foundations Rainey and Jan Burres had told Chris about. Hundreds of people in tents and trailers, a quarter inch to the right of a Rainbow Gathering as hillbillies and renegades mix with the hippies. There are canvas-covered booths set up for swap and trade. Even a few makeshift food stands. We SEE that many of the inhabitants have set up CHRISTMAS TREES outside their trailers and tents. Kids play naked in a mud pool.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE BOOTH OF JAN & RAINEY, THE SLABS - SAME
N: We see Rainey selling their wares. Beside the booth, their van with its backseat door open. A little dog, Sunni, jumps out the van door, sniffing something out. Jan exits the van after the dog.
C: JAN
D: Sunni! Come here boy.
N: But Sunni has sniffed out Chris' large backpack leaning against the rear of the van. Jan is just beginning to recognize it, when from behind the van appears Chris, looking like a million bucks.
C: CHRIS
D: Surprise!
C: JAN
D: Alex!
E: overjoyed
N: As she goes to hug him - ANGLE: Rainey hearing his name, jumps up from his stool to join them. Big embraces all around.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE SLABS - NIGHT
N: An impromptu campfire celebration with live music from a makeshift stage. Jan, Rainey, and Chris sit on chairs outside the circle of inhabitants, taking in the music.
C: JAN
D: You have to tell us everything. (Note: This scene should largely be improvised. They all know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him, Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA.
N: Jan remarks, "I guess if you can figure out how to paddle a canoe down to Mexico, hop freight trains, and score beds at inner-city missions, you can figure out Alaska too.") At this point, the PRETTY 16-YEAR OLD GIRL who had had her eyes on Chris, takes the stage with an acoustic guitar, introduces herself as TRACY, then SINGS an * innocent love song of her own composition, stealing seductive glances at Chris throughout the performance.
C: JAN
D: I think you've made yourself a friend.
E: CONT'D

D: She's only a teenager.
E: blushing

D: Good luck.
N: The girl finishes her song.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE BOOTH OF JAN & RAINEY - DAY
N: Chris and Rainey man the second-hand goods booth while Jan bathes Sunni in a steel bucket by the van. Among the goods, a USED ORGAN. Chris is thrilled to have access to all the second-hand books that are part of Rainey and Jan's inventory. As he skims through Jack London's Odyssey of the North, Rainey notices Tracy sitting on the * steps of her vagabond parents' rig across from the booth. She picks silently at her guitar with her bright eyes fixed on Chris.
C: RAINEY
D: How long can you stay with us?
C: CHRIS
D: Well, I'm waiting on a check from my last job to come into Salton City the day after Christmas. I've got to start thinking about getting ready for Alaska. When the sun gets a little lower tonight, I'm going to start a calisthenics routine. I think after the check comes in, I'll try to find some mountains I can climb everyday till spring comes. I gotta see how far the money's gonna go.
E: MORE
C: CHRIS
D: I'm going to have to pick up a lot of supplies before spring. So, I might take another job or I might be okay.
E: CONT'D
C: RAINEY
D: Well, you know, we'll give you a little something for every day you work the booth.
C: CHRIS
D: I'm not taking any money from you, Rainey. It's been a real great twist meeting you two. You look like you're doing good.
C: RAINEY
D: We are, and you were a big part of that, coming along when you did. Yep, things are good. Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just a bunch of reading. Speaking of which, don't you think you ought to introduce yourself to Joni Mitchell over there?
E: gives a little giggle
N: Chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year old smile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back, * and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave- over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step, * putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a little wood nymph to Chris. TRACY * Hi.
C: CHRIS
D: Hi. TRACY * You selling books?
C: CHRIS
D: I am. We are.
N: TRACY * I read a lot.
C: CHRIS
D: Do you?
N: TRACY * Yeah.
C: CHRIS
D: That's good. I heard you play your song last night.
N: TRACY * (embarrassed) I'm terrible. Rainey amused by all of this.
C: CHRIS
D: You are not terrible.
N: TRACY * I'm not?
C: CHRIS
D: No. You sing sweet.
N: TRACY * Thank you. I was going to go watch the kids play in the mud. Do you want to go?
C: RAINEY
D: Go on. I'll watch the store.
C: CHRIS
D: I'm sorry. This is Rainey. And I'm Chris.
N: Whoops, a slip on the name, but...
C: RAINEY
D: Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex. TRACY * I'm Tracy. *
E: "Don't lie to her."
N: Chris realizes his slip but before Rainey can question anything, Chris stands and goes off with Tracy. * Rainey and Jan share a conspiratorial smile.
S: EXT. THE MUD PIT, THE SLABS - SAME
N: (Salvation Mountain?) (Leonard?) LONG LENS: We watch Chris and Tracy sit pit-side with a * foreground of frolicking naked children splashing about in the mud. We don't hear their conversation. We just watch its gentleness.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RAINEY & JAN'S VAN, THE SLABS - NIGHT
N: Tracy helps Rainey cook dinner on the barbecue, meaning * to demonstrate to Chris what a wonderful wife she would be. Jan and Chris sipping on beers sit beside each other on folding chairs, out of Rainey and Tracy's earshot. *
C: JAN
D: I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got * pregnant. And I thought my husband and I were going to invent peace on earth and stay together forever. But it didn't work out that way. He left. History. Now ancient history. And that was the end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And that was really good for a while. But Reno was already a teenager and was becoming a man in his own way. And then, I don't know. He kinda followed in his father's footsteps - out the door and gone. And I really don't know where he is. I haven't heard from him in two years.
C: CHRIS
D: I hope I get to meet him sometime. Jan looks into Chris' eyes and smiles with pure love. She leans over and gently kisses Chris on the cheek.
C: JAN
D: Do your folks know where you are?
N: Chris aims to deflect the question as Tracy enters the * scene. TRACY * Soup's on. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you guys getting heavy?
C: JAN
D: No, sweetheart. Just hungry. You've been doing a fantastic job over there. Shall we eat?
E: to Chris
C: CHRIS

N: MUSIC OVER: MONTAGE: 1. Chris reading and selling books. 2. Chris and Tracy taking walks with Sunni. * 3. Rainey and Jan stealing some afternoon delight in the van. (It's the days of wine and roses) 4. Chris' new daily regimen of calisthenics. 5. Tracy's new daily regimen of watching Chris do * calisthenics. His lean body tighter and stronger everyday.

S: EXT. RAINEY & JAN'S VAN, THE SLABS - (CHRISTMAS) DAY
N: Rainey stands over Chris as Chris does sit-ups. Rainey's gut hanging a little heavy over his belt. OS VOICES exchange Christmas greetings.
C: RAINEY
D: I really ought to get myself doing that.
C: CHRIS
D: You should Rainey. Makes that Tantric stuff go even better.
C: RAINEY
D: How the hell would you know? That poor girl over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post. And here you are, the monk of Jack LaLane.
N: They share a laugh. Chris comes to the end of his sit- ups. Wipes his brow with a towel. Rainey squats down next to him.
C: RAINEY
D: I guess Jan filled you in. About Reno and everything. Children can be harsh judges when it comes to their parents. They don't grant clemency easily. I think Reno tended to see things in black and white. I just hope he lives long enough to forgive her.
E: CONT'D
N: The connection is not lost on Chris.
C: RAINEY
D: But painful as it is, you turned a light on in her and I'm grateful.
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Me too.
C: RAINEY
D: For what?
N: Chris doesn't answer. A kid rides by on a bright new Big Wheel. Must be from the rich side of the commune.
C: RAINEY
D: Do your folks know where you are?
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: No.
C: RAINEY
D: Don't you think they ought to?
C: CHRIS
D: They should. But I can't. Not yet, anyway. I got a sister though, Carine. She's the most beautiful girl in the world. But, it's all got to stay behind me until I get where I'm going.
C: RAINEY
D: Alaska?
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.
N: Rainey won't intrude any further. He just nods. Chris notices Tracy in the door of her parent's rig, stealthily * waving him over. Chris gives Rainey the "Uh-oh" look, pulls on his T-shirt, and walks over to the rig. Tracy * has disappeared inside.
T: CUT TO:
S: 165 INT. TRACY'S PARENTS RIG - SAME 165 *
N: Chris pops his head in.
C: CHRIS
D: Hello? Merry Christmas?
N: TRACY (O.C.) * Come in here. As Chris mounts the steps, he finds Tracy laying on the * bed inside, wearing a skimpy white girl's tank top and underpants. TRACY (CONT'D) * Guess what.
C: CHRIS
D: What?
E: deer in headlights
N: TRACY * My parents went into town.
C: CHRIS
D: No!
N: TRACY * Yes, they did. They went to call my grandma for Christmas.
C: CHRIS
D: No, I mean, no, we can't do that.
N: TRACY * Why not? Chris moves to sit on the edge of her bed. Tracy sits up * beside him.
C: CHRIS
D: How old are you?
N: TRACY * Eighteen. Chris throws her a look of doubt. TRACY (CONT'D) * Seventeen.
C: CHRIS
D: What year were you born?
N: As soon as she has to think about it, the jig is up.
C: CHRIS
D: You want to do something together?
E: CONT'D
N: Shyly, she shakes her head "yes."
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE SLABS - NIGHT
N: We SEE the used Christmas trees of the residents being thrown onto an existing campfire, building into the enormous, celebratory bonfire that lights the scene. As we did with the footsteps in the mud and the kayak slashing the sand, we TRACK VERTICALLY along an extension cord from one of the trailer generators to the stage until we find - Tracy with her guitar and Chris with the second-hand * organ from Rainey and Jan's booth on the stage. They enter into a duet of John Prine's Angel from Montgomery for the crowd of the Slabs' fire-lit inhabitants. In the crowd, we find Rainey and Jan clapping and dancing along to Chris and Tracy's song. Merry Christmas. *
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE SLABS - DAY
N: Jan is pulling the van out from their plot. Rainey is guiding the single-directional vehicle. Chris and Tracy stand beside the car path. Chris writes * down Wayne Westerberg's Carthage address.

D: You can always get in touch with me by sending mail here. I don't know when I'll get it, but I'll get it.
N: TRACY * (crying) Okay.
C: CHRIS
D: You're pretty magic.
N: TRACY * I am? He hugs her. And kisses her. (cheek, lips? I don't know.) Jan pulls up in the van. Rainey walks over to Chris and gives him a paternal hug.
C: RAINEY
D: You take care of yourself, kiddo.
C: CHRIS
D: You too, Rainey. Thanks for everything.
N: Chris gives Rainey's gut a full-hand pinch.
C: CHRIS
D: New Year's resolution?
E: CONT'D
N: Rainey gives him a wink and puts his arm around Tracy as * Chris jumps into the car. Then he and Jan hit the road.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MARKET POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - DAY
N: This market/liquor store/post office serves as the cultural nexus for the greater Salton Sea area. As Jan's van pulls up opposite the post office and makes a U-turn to curbside, Chris gets out of the van. Now Jan's eyes really well up.
C: JAN
D: Just get your pack out of the back and get out of here. I can't take a hug.
E: sweetly
N: Chris says nothing. He just looks at Jan. They understand each other. Chris closes the door. He fiddles with the broken handle of the back door, gets it open, gets his pack out. On top of his pack, A WRAPPED XMAS GIFT and when he closes the back door, Jan heads straight off back to the Slabs. Chris opens the giftwrap; it's the new hat Jan had promised. Chris is touched.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TWO-LANED ROAD, ANNANDALE, VA (PAST) - DAY
N: TELEPHOTO LENS: A long two-laned road before us rises and falls in a series of saddles and peaks. The narrow shoulders are densely wooded. SLOWLY APPEARING over the near most peak, a TEAM OF EIGHT SHIRTLESS HIGH SCHOOL RUNNERS. Leading the group - 17 YEAR-OLD CHRISTOPHER MCCANDLESS. Lean, softly handsome, and graceful.
C: CARINE
D: In high school, Chris became captain of the cross-country track team. They called themselves the Road Warriors.
E: V.O.
N: REVERSE ANGLE: The group of young runners, led by Chris suddenly veer off the paved road into the adjoining woods.
S: EXT. TRAILS, ANNANDALE (PAST) - DAY
N: SERIES OF ANGLES: The runners, led by Chris, pace unchartered trails, grassy hillsides, and shallow streams.
C: CARINE
D: He'd take them on what he loved to refer to as "epic" runs. The whole point was to run until they were completely lost and so exhausted that they were on the verge of puking. Then they'd slow down a little, somehow he'd find their bearings, and lead them home again at full speed. This was my brothers idea of fun.
N: We FAVOR Chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating point of being lost. When he has identified a most likely return route, he quickens his pace, leading the group in the direction of return.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY
N: Chris heads out with his last Burger King check in hand, proudly wearing his new hat and in search of mountains to climb.
C: CARINE
D: A year and a half into Chris' disappearance, each day that goes by now feels like two. Dad calls it "suspended animation." I kept telling myself that he had to get lost to prove his independence to himself. But this was no day run for the Road Warriors and after so much time, I could no longer keep out the haunting thoughts.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - DAY
N: Chris, with pack and new hat walks away from camera toward the interstate and the brittle mountains beyond.
C: CARINE
D: In many ways, my life and even my parents had begun to move in new directions. I'd fallen in love. And mom and dad had even ventured out on a brief vacation. But, when a search of tax records uncovered Chris' contribution to OXFAM, the weight of his disappearance just seemed to lie down on us full length.

T: WISDOM DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BADLANDS OF ANZA-BORREGO DESERT STATE PARK - DAY
N: (JANUARY 1992) WIDE SHOT: We see the Oh My God Hot Springs. Steaming pools lined with rocks and shaded by palm trees. A small group of campers and Charlie Manson wannabes in FOREGROUND. We ZOOM past them to the sheer rock faces and landforms of the badlands, several miles beyond.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STONE WALL, ANZA-BORREGO DESERT - DAY

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - DAY
N: Chris rests on the sand under a tarp, hung from a Creosote branch. A plate of beans and rice eaten nearly clean and an empty water jug beside him. Flies buzz and pick.
T: CUT TO:

N: Chris on a morning jog, wearing a shoulder bag and carrying an empty water jug. A quick wave to one of his distant "neighbors" at the spring's camp as he runs by.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PAVED TWO-LANE ROAD INTO SALTON CITY - DAY
N: Chris continues his jog, cars whisk by and dust kicks into the air. But Chris is undeterred, keeps running.
S: EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - SAME
N: Chris approaches, slowing his jog to a walk. Chris sets down his water jug and stretches his calves. In the distance we see the peaks of the badlands landforms from where he ran. Chris shakes off the jog, picks up the jug, and we go with him around the side of the building. There's a water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud. Chris pops his jug under it and fills it up.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MARKET/POST OFFICE - SAME
N: Chris walks the aisles, sipping from his jug, as he comes across bags of rice on the market shelves. A HEAVY SET GIRL passes him in the aisle with her well-mannered dog following her.
C: CHRIS
D: Hey boy. You are a handsome fellow. Beautiful dog.
E: no high-pitched pet voice over shoulder to the girl
C: THE GIRL
D: Thank you.
N: As the girl continues on, the dog wants to stay with Chris.
C: CHRIS
D: Go on, boy. Go on.
N: And the dog obeys him. As he sorts through the various rice selections, brown, white, wild, we notice a MAN peering over the opposite shelf at Chris. This is RON FRANZ, between 70 and 80 years old, six-feet, thick arms, barrel chest, and large ears. He wears old jeans, an immaculate white T-shirt, a decorative tooled leather belt, white socks, and scuffed black loafers. His deeply pitted nose demonstrates a purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely wrought tattoo. And on either side of it, the wary blue eyes of a soldier. He is the archetypical American man. Chris has caught his sympathetic eye. Chris moves to the counter to pay for rice.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE - SAME
N: In WIDE SHOT, we watch Chris from behind, walking out across the two-lane road. He puts out his thumb to hitch a ride. When a truck comes from BEHIND INTO FRAME heading straight for Chris, the truck makes a relaxed L-turn, pulling up beside Chris.
S: INT. RON'S TRUCK
C: RON
D: Where's your camp?
C: CHRIS
D: Out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.
E: pointing
C: RON
D: I've lived in and around here six years now and I've never heard of any place that goes by that name.
N: Ron leans across the bench seat of the truck, opening up the passenger door.
C: RON
D: Show me how to get there.
E: CONT'D
N: Chris hops in beside Ron, who extends his hand -
C: RON
D: Ron Franz.
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Alex.
C: RON
D: Alex. Where are you from Alex?
C: CHRIS
D: West Virginia.
C: RON
D: Okay, Alex from West Virginia. I like a fellow who doesn't raise the pitch of his voice when he talks to animals...shows he doesn't condescend.
N: Chris remembers now the dog in the store and why Ron must've thought to give him a ride. And they head off.
S: EXT. FEW MILES UP ROAD
N: Ron truck drives up the road.
S: INT. RON'S TRUCK
N: As we come upon a 4x4 track twisting down a narrow wash -
C: CHRIS
D: You go left here.
N: Ron turns the truck down the 4x4 track.
S: EXT. 4X4 TRACK, ANZA-BORREGO DESERT - SAME
N: We watch the truck bump and grind on the mangled dirt road about a mile in. Out the window, Ron's eye has been caught by something. Ron's POV: Oh-My-God Hot Springs - We see a couple of day-glo vans and rusted out Studebakers that hadn't been turned over since Eisenhower was in the White House. Several of those living there mill about buck naked. And at the center of the camp, the steaming pools lined with rocks under the palm trees.
C: RON
D: You live here?
C: CHRIS
D: No, we keep going. I'm further up. Another half-mile or so, out on the Bajada.
S: EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - SAME
N: Ron and Chris drive up in the truck. Ron shuts off the ignition and gets out of the truck to stretch his legs. Chris follows, puts his full water jug under the tarp at his campsite, hooking it onto a branch. He throws his shoulder bag with the rice in it into his backpack.
C: RON
D: Well, this is somethin' out here. Don't you worry about those dope smokers and nudists down below there?
C: CHRIS
D: No, they keep to themselves pretty much and so do I.
C: RON
D: Hmmm. You strike me as a bright young man. Am I wrong about that?
E: skeptical
C: CHRIS
D: I think I got my head on my shoulders pretty good.
C: RON
D: That's what I mean. How long have you been out here?
C: CHRIS
D: Couple of weeks.
C: RON
D: And before that?
C: CHRIS
D: A lot of places. I've been moving around.
C: RON
D: How old are you?
C: CHRIS
D: Twenty-three.
C: RON
D: Twenty-three years old! Son, don't you think you should be getting an education? And a job? And making something of this life?
C: CHRIS
D: Look Mr. Franz. I think careers are a twentieth century invention and I don't want one. You don't need to worry about me. I have a college education. I'm not destitute. I'm living like this by choice.
C: RON
D: In the dirt?
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, in the dirt.
E: laughs
C: RON
D: I just don't know. Where's your family?
C: CHRIS
D: Don't have one anymore.
C: RON
D: That's a shame.
N: Chris can see some deep sadness in this man.
C: CHRIS
D: Hey, Mr. Franz. I want to show you something.
N: Ron follows Chris to the rockface we'd seen Chris running earlier. They begin to walk up it. It's tough on the old-timer, walking this steep hill. But he's a tough old- timer, at least for the moment... ANGLE: The two men nearly half way to the summit. It's getting steeper and higher. Ron stops.
C: RON
D: This is getting a little steep. And a little high for me kid.
C: CHRIS
D: Alright. But look out there. Even from half way out, it's quite a sight isn't it?
N: Their POV: Enormous beautiful vista all the way across the Bajada.
C: CHRIS
D: From the top you can see all the way to the Salton Sea too. Ron looks up the precarious rock wall. He ain't gonna be seeing the Salton Sea today.
E: CONT'D
C: RON
D: You can see the Salton Sea from up there?
C: CHRIS
D: Yes, sir.
C: RON
D: My goodness.
E: starting his way down the hill
C: CHRIS
D: You don't want to go up?
C: RON
D: Nope. I don't do these kind of things.
N: Chris smiles and follows Ron. As they approach the bottom of the hill -
C: RON
D: How about you and me take a drive? About fifty miles or so up highway, I know a place that's got a view, great food, and requires no climbing. How's that sound?
E: CONT'D
N: Chris thinks about it. Then -
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of minutes to clean up.
C: RON
D: Fair enough.

N: VERTICAL POV: We are thousands of feet in the air over the rigid rocky canyon as we ascend toward San Jacinto summit. It's high. Scary HIGH.
S: INT. TRAM
N: MUSIC OVER: As Chris and Ron ride the tram to the peak, we watch Chris watching Ron, his kind, moist old eyes, slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature around him. Other passengers on the tram seem nervous, but Ron is meditative, almost hypnotized. And with each roll-through of the tram through the cable towers, the tram car rocks and sways, but Ron's peace goes unbroken. And Chris continues to admire the gentle blinking of his eyes.
T: CUT TO:

N: The two of them sit in a quiet, corner booth of the tramway eatery that sits on the summit of San Jacinto overlooking the lights of Palm Springs and the desert clear back to Salton Sea. Chris is on a roll.
C: CHRIS
D: How old are you, Mr. Franz?
C: RON
D: Seventy-nine years old.
C: CHRIS
D: Seventy-nine...see, all due respect, but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long they've trudged around like a dip-shit.
N: Ron laughs.
C: CHRIS
D: But it's true.
E: CONT'D
C: RON
D: It is. No question about that.
N: Ron continues to let Chris vent.
C: CHRIS
D: The government's the same as my parents. They don't respect anybody. Regulation. Regulation. Regulation. WE can't do this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the hypocrisy of the whole...culture. Makes me crazy. My father was having children * with two women at the same time, and then * has the gall to think that he can be of some guidance to me? Make judgments on me? My mother, of course, goes along with all of it. Keeps the secret, which of course, makes my whole life a fiction. Everything I thought was, wasn't. They're such fools! Fucking idiots!
C: RON
D: Alex, please don't lump me in amongst your judges. And your tyrants. But I'd prefer to not hear that kind of language.
C: CHRIS
D: Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of language either. I just get so angry thinking about it.

D: You got a lot of passion, young man.
N: Chris smiles at Ron.

S: EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - NIGHT
N: As Ron and Chris pull up in the pick-up truck, we see SPORADIC FIREWORKS WHISTLING AND CRACKLING into the air above the hot-springs, and HEAR the distant HOOTING of its inhabitants. Chris hops out and walks around to Ron's side of the truck.
C: CHRIS
D: Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz. Thank you.
C: RON
D: Look here. If Charles Manson and his buddies don't kill me on my way out of here, I'd like to cook you up a home cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come out here about, say, four o'clock tomorrow, how would that be?
C: CHRIS
D: That would be swell.
N: Ron is thrilled.
C: RON
D: Good, good. I'm no gourmet but I know where the spices are. Good night, kid.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RON'S HOUSE, SALTON SEA - SUNSET
N: The house is a single-level, beige structure, sitting between the Salton Sea and a small inlet where he keeps a fishing boat. Underneath a canopy in the backyard, there is a small workshop of some kind. HIGH ANGLE: Chris, looking at his own reflection in the water below Ron's dock. In the reflection, we see his hands full of dirty laundry.

S: INT. KITCHEN, RON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: As Chris enters, Ron is pulling the steaks from the broiler. Above the kitchen sink, Chris sees a row of approximately ten photographs, each in vertical 4x6 frames, some black and white, some color: all of Japanese boys and girls in formal American and Japanese attire.
C: RON
D: Did you find everything you need?
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah. I hope I don't wreck your machine. There's a lot of grime in that stuff.
E: breaking his gaze from the photographs
C: RON
D: Well, that's what it's for. How do these steaks look?
N: Ron pops the steaks on the kitchen table.
C: CHRIS
D: Great.

D: Well, sit down.
N: Ron grabs some silverware from a drawer, plops it down on the kitchen table with some paper napkins.

D: What do you drink?
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: You got a White Russian?
C: RON
D: Nope.
C: CHRIS
D: Beer?
C: RON
D: Nope. Don't have any alcohol. I had to quit all that. How about a guava juice?
C: CHRIS
D: I'll take a guava juice, that sounds good.
N: As Ron gets the drinks -
C: RON
D: Yeah, I had a little spell with the bottle, you could say.
N: Ron pops the drinks down on the table, then sits with Chris. They lift their glasses toward one another, then -
C: RON/CHRIS
D: Cheers.
C: RON
D: I spent most of my life in the army. On New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in the States, just driving down the road when a fellow who'd had too much to drink plowed right into them. Killed them both. Anyway, you might think that the last thing in the world I'd do, is go to the whiskey, but at the time, it felt like the only thing I could do. And I did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured I wasn't doing my wife and son any good, mourning them with a bottle. So, I pulled myself together and quit drinking, cold turkey. And then...
N: Ron, spinning his body around, points to the photographs over the sink.
C: RON
D: You see all these kids over here?
E: CONT'D brightening
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, I was gonna ask you.
C: RON
D: Yeah, that's... Fuki, Kenjiro, Yoshiko, Keiko, Masaro, Junichi, Kimpei, Nayoko...
E: pointing at each with his finger
N: For the last picture frame, Ron stands and takes it off the shelf -
C: RON
D: And this is Akira. Just finished medical school.
E: CONT'D pridefully shows Chris the picture
N: Chris takes the picture and studies Akira's face. Ron sits back down.
C: RON
D: Yeah, I unofficially adopted all of them. It did my heart some good but I guess really it was just writing a few letters and sending some money. Anyway, it was important to me. I get a letter from each of them from time to time. You know. So, since all that, this is pretty much me.
E: CONT'D indicating his small reclusive abode
C: CHRIS
D: Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?
C: RON
D: No. I can't seem to get too far from my leather. I'll show you after you finish eating. I do a lot of leather engraving. I got a little workshop in the garage. Between that and my pension, I do pretty well. But every time I think I might take a trip somewhere, I get too far behind on orders and such to consider it.
C: CHRIS
D: Well, I'm finished eating. I'd love to see your workshop.
E: having wolfed down the steak

N: Ron waves him off.
C: CHRIS
D: Really. You're going to live a long time, Ron. You should make a radical change in your lifestyle. The core of man's spirit comes with new experiences. And there you are, stubborn old man, sitting on your butt.

D: Come on, old man! Come on!
C: RON
D: Ya little pinhead.
E: mumbling
N: Chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts. Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's walk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he shows he's got it in him after all. As Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends a hand. Ron swats it away.
C: RON
D: Ya little pinhead.
E: CONT'D
N: Ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let his thumping heart slow down.
C: CHRIS
D: You alright?
N: Ron, after taking one more deep breath, sits up and Chris sits next to him. He's actually pretty happy with himself. He looks out and sees the distant Salton Sea.
C: RON
D: I'm going to miss you when you go.
C: CHRIS
D: I'll miss you too, Ron. But you're wrong if you think the joy of life comes principally from human relationships. God's placed it all around us. It's in everything. In anything we can experience. People just have to change the way they think about those things. You ought to put a little camper on the back of your pick-up and go take a look at some of the great work god's done out here in the American west.
C: RON
D: Alex...You're probably right. And I'm going to take stock of that.
N: Chris offers a skeptical glance.
C: RON
D: No, I am.
E: CONT'D
N: A second skeptical glance. Which Ron squashes with genuine sincerity.
C: RON
D: I am.
E: CONT'D almost to himself
N: Chris buys it this time and feels he's accomplished something with Ron.
C: RON
D: But I'll tell you something. The bits and pieces I've put together, you know, what you've told me about your family. Your mother and dad. And I know you got your problems with the church too, but there's some kind of bigger thing that we can all appreciate. And it sounds like you don't mind calling it God. But when you forgive, you love. And when you love...God's light shines on you.
E: CONT'D
N: Miraculously, it is just at that moment that the cloud clears from the sun and the light shines in Ron's eyes. Chris points at Ron's face at the light shining on him -
C: CHRIS
D: Holy Shit!
C: RON
D: I told you about that language. The two men, their eyes welling up, fall back laughing.

C: CHRIS
D: What are you doing up? It's three-thirty in the morning.
C: RON
D: Heard you get up off the couch half an hour ago, and had a funny feeling you might not be here for our breakfast.
N: Chris says nothing.
C: RON
D: I'm going to drive you a hundred miles to somewhere where you can pick up a train, a plane, or hitch a ride without getting stuck on this desert. I'd take you all the way to Alaska if I didn't have to get to an eight o'clock mass.
E: CONT'D

D: Ron, you don't have to do that.
C: RON
D: I want to do it. Get you started on this thing of yours.
C: CHRIS
D: On my Great -
C: RON
D: I know. On your "Great Alaskan Adventure." From just out of Chris' eye-line, Ron leans out of frame, picking up a zippered duffel bag. He opens it, displaying the contents to Chris.
E: interrupting

D: There's a machete, an arctic parka, collapsible fishing pole, and a few odds and ends I threw in there for you.

D: Yep.
N: Both of them are uncomfortable. Chris goes for the door handle. Ron's gnarled hand reaches out to take Chris' elbow. After a long beat, Ron speaks without looking at Chris.
C: RON
D: I had an idea. You know my mother was an only child. So was my father. And I was their only child. Now, with my own boy gone, I'm the end of the line. When I'm gone, my family will be finished. What do you say, you let me adopt you. I could be, say, your grandfather.
N: This takes Chris by surprise. He knew it would be hard but not this hard.
C: CHRIS
D: How about we talk about this when I get back from Alaska, Ron. Would that be alright?
N: Silence. Ron nods. Releases Chris' elbow.
C: CHRIS
D: Alright, Ron. We'll talk about it then.
E: CONT'D
C: RON
D: Yep. We can do that, yep.
E: trying to mask. The blinking, moist eyes again

D: Thanks, Ron.
N: Ron nods. Chris gets out of the truck. Ron watches as Chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that Ron gave him. Chris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a ride north on the far side of the road. We ZOOM SLOWLY through the windshield into Ron's face as he watches Chris hitching away.

N: We return to the area of Scene #1. MUSIC OVER: Of religious scope. Perhaps choral. HELICOPTER SHOT: We travel a long ways across snowy peaks and valleys (clearly far from anywhere) passing between two escarpments of outer range bordering bottomlands five miles wide until we barely see a tiny form within it trudging through the snow. We overfly it.

N: Its banks lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow. At its center, a channel of gently flowing water, opaque with glacial till. Beyond the far ice shelf, Chris appears from the riverside treeline. He eases across the ice, then wades through the latte-colored channel and on to the other side. REVERSE ANGLE: Chris moving toward the opposite tree line, he turns back to the gentle river behind. Chris' POV scanning the terrain. From the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a second mountain peak, triangulating his location.

N: CAMERA ANGLED SKYWARD into the broken rays of grey light. We TILT DOWN to find (and TRACK through the trees with) Chris moving along the river, when he sees something just OFF CAMERA. Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on into the clearing, where before him: A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International Harvester from the 1940's. Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized. Weathered lettering: Fairbanks City Transit System Bus
S: INT. BUS
N: Broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. Chris may well have found his new home. The bus is outfitted with a bunk and a barrel stove. Previous visitors had left it stocked with matches, bug dope, and other essentials.
S: EXT. BUS
N: We follow Chris back out of the bus, surveying the area of the clearing. He loves what he sees. CELEBRATORY MUSIC OVER: He runs up a berm to look down into the river. He runs from corner to corner of this "Magic Bus" area like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee. He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into water, and swallows it. CRANE SHOT: We PULL UP from Chris to high above the clearing.

Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide one. Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM! the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below, saving himself from a certain death. We SEE the broken branch catapulted down river and into a rocky shoot below. He pulls himself back onto the bank, drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting position beside it.

It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to his feet. Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps. From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest. We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him. He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph identifying the wild potato root and the word "edible" beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there might be more. The word - POISON jumps off the page at him. The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato root and warns that those with: lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of wild sweet peas are poisonous. The words - ...leading to partial motor paralysis... ...inhibition of digestion... ...nausea, starvation... ECU: ...STARVATION CRASH ZOOM into Chris' face, realizing his desperate plight.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BUS
N: Chris kneels, holding one of the potato seeds to the sunlight and there we see them - the lateral veins that indicate poisonous seeds.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BUS - DAY
N: Chris, barely able to walk, moves, at the pace of an elderly man, with his rifle, through the underbrush. He needs food now.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: He shoots a squirrel. But as he moves toward what he thinks is his kill, the squirrel makes off with a bleeding tail. Chris fires several desperate shots at the squirrel but misses with each one.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BUS - NIGHT
N: Chris, having a fitful sleep. Short breaths and mutterings.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CLEARING AROUND BUS - NIGHT
N: A big moon shines above and we find on a tree branch, the squirrel Chris had clipped in the tail earlier in the day. On the last legs of bleeding to death, it falls from the tree. The moon becomes the sun and we pass a couple of days through visions of the nature about in varying light.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SUSHANA RIVER - DAY
N: Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full. He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening. He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs. It's all he can do just to breath. WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the river's edge catching his breath framed against the background of the 3000 foot butte that he'd so recently climbed with ease. Now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near CAMERA RIGHT into frame. Bit by bit we'll realize it's a LARGE BEAR ENTERING FRAME and moving away from camera toward Chris. It lumbers to within feet of him. CU OVER BEAR onto Chris: Chris, passive to the bear's presence. ANGLE: The bear, just as passive towards Chris, as though he didn't represent enough of anything to eat. BACK TO TABLEAU as the bear, passing Chris, disappears over the rise toward the river. Chris, a motionless and slight silhouette.

S: 266A INT. BUS - NIGHT 266A
N: Chris lays on the floor. CU Chris: Orange light twinkles in his eyes. Chris' POV: through the bus window, we see the orange glow of smoke rising into the air. CU: Chris writes in his diary log.
C: CHRIS
D: Set small signal fire today - watched it die tonight.
E: V.O.
N: Back to POV as the ambient orange light fades into the blackness of smoke.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BUS - DAY
N: The diary/log: DAY 100 - MADE IT. BUT IN WEAKEST CONDITION OF LIFE. TOO WEAK TO WALK OUT. HAVE LITERALLY BECOME TRAPPED IN THE WILD - NO GAME IN SIGHT. A SUBTLE DRUM (HEART)BEAT BEGINS OVER: Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. He shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. But taking his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an option for him. "No, no, no, don't do this to me." The frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream out. He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakes it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for distraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses his eyes on the page - ANGLE: The page: what he reads:
C: CHRIS
D: And that an unshared happiness is not happiness...
E: V.0 O.C.
N: Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the book, scribbling across the page:
C: CHRIS
D: HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED.
E: V.O. O.C. CONT'D
N: He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had written the quote:
C: CHRIS
D: CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME.
E: V.O. O.C. CONT'D
N: He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the pencil across its blank side, writing these words quickly, as if in panic: I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL! And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris repeating:
C: CHRIS
D: Call everything by its right name.
E: O.C. CONT'D with a weak voice
N: The drumbeat increases as he signs the note: CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes dance wildly. The drumming intensifies. Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud. His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at the blue sleeping bag made by his mother. With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the sleeping bag. SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun. Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face. (Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.)
S: INT./EXT. BUS
N: We INTERCUT between Chris and the sky in a dance transitioning to the next world. It is hopeful, anguished, sad, and elated.
S: INT./EXT. ANNANDALE HOUSE - DAY
N: Chris, approaching the Annandale house. His backpack on and body healthy. Billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris approach, alive and healthy. We SEE but do not hear her call to Walt. A smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home. Walt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run out the front door to their returning son. PUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the ground and runs toward his parents' embrace.
C: CHRIS
D: What if you saw me running into your arms...
E: V.O.
N: Chris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and loving embrace!
C: CHRIS
D: Would you see then...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: The DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an embrace is possible...
C: CHRIS
D: ...what I see now? A SUDDEN CUT TO:
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. BUS
N: TOTAL SILENCE Chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud clears the sun. Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH. His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true, deep serenity. The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom. That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly into our camera. And he died alive. He made it. He lived. He loved. Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER: As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window and up into the sky - We drift further and further away, above the stunted trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and smaller. REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in scene #1. Then it's him: The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen, we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these words appear superimposed over it: Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992 As those words dissolve, these words appear: On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard. She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack. THE END
